# Seeking support?

We only use this issue tracker for bug reports and new example requests. We are not able to provide general support or answer questions in the form of GitHub issues.

For general questions about discord.js installation and use please use the dedicated support channels in our Discord server: https://discord.gg/djs

Any issues that don't directly involve a bug or a new example request will likely be closed and redirected.
