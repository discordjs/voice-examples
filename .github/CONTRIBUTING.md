# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/djs) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the discord.js codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **main** branch
2. Run `npm clean-install` ([install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-ci))
3. Code your heart out!
4. Run `npm run format && npm run lint` to make sure your changes follow our coding style
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/discordjs/voice-examples/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/discordjs/voice-examples/blob/main/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))
